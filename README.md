# ThreadDumpTest
A small java program that runs infinitely to allow you to test the JVM thread dumping tool.

Should be simple to run.
Run the program and follow the steps listed on https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/TakeThreadDump.html

To end the program use the command "kill \<pid>" in terminal

If you are not comfortable with creating and running a java project then a .jar file is also attached (it was compiled for java 8, so may not work in earlier versions).
